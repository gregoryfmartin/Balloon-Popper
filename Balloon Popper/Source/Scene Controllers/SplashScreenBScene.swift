/// Splash Screen B is the second splash screen that is shown after the game launches. This screen shows after Splash Screen A.
/// Splash Screen B shows the Snowy Bear Production logo and screen. The bear walks toward the center of the screen, scales forward, and then the words "Snowy Bear" fly in from the top and the word "Productions" fly in from the bottom. At this point, a small jingle plays.
/// The transition to the next scene is controlled by the GameMaster (this is actually the best way to transition scenes that are timed).
